# Greco

Circuit for proving the correct encryption under BFV fully homomorphic encryption scheme. Note that this can be also generalized to any RLWE-based FHE scheme. Based on https://hackmd.io/@gaussian/r1W98Kqqa.

### Generate Parameters

To generate the parameters for the secret key proof of encryption circuit run the following command:

```bash
python3 scripts/circuit_sk.py -n 1024 -qis '[                                      
    1152921504606584833,
    1152921504598720513,
    1152921504597016577,
    1152921504595968001,
    1152921504595640321,
    1152921504593412097,
    1152921504592822273,
    1152921504592429057,
    1152921504589938689,
    1152921504586530817,
    1152921504585547777,
    1152921504583647233,
    1152921504581877761,

]' -t 65537  -output_input ./src/data/sk_enc_input.json -output_constants ./src/constants/sk_enc.rs
```

Where `-n` is the degree of the polynomial, `-qis` is the list of moduli qis such that qis[i] is the modulus of the i-th CRT basis of the modulus q of the ciphertext space, `-t` is the plaintext modulus and `-output_input` is path to the json file containing the circuit input and `-output_constants` is the path to the rust file containing the circuit generic constants. The value of `ùúé` for the gaussian distribution is set to 3.2 by default.

You can modify these parameters to fit your needs.

As a result:
- A file `./src/data/sk_enc_input.json` is generated including the input to the circuit that can be used for testing. It includes a random secret key, a random plaintext message and the corresponding ciphertext encrypted under the secret key.
- A file `./src/constants/sk_enc.rs` is generated including the generic constants for the circuit. Note that we separate them from the input because these should be known at compile time.

On top of that, the console will print an estimatation of the number of advice cells needed to compile the circuit in halo2 considering a single advice column and a lookup table of size 2^8.

### Circuit

```
cargo build
cargo test --release -- --nocapture
```

The halo2 circuit is based on a fork of `axiom-eth` that implements two minor changes:

- `RlcCircuit` and `RlcExecutor` are included into a utils mod such that they can be consumed outside of the crate 
- The `RlcCircuitInstructions` are modified to enable equality constraints on instance column in Second Phase

Further testing, incorporating the whole flow of generating random parameters and random input and generating a proof can be run with:

```
python3 scripts/test.py 20
```

Where `20` is number of times the test should be run. Any error is added to the `scripts/error_log.txt` file.
