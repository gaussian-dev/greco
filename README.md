# proof

Circuit for proving the correct encryption under BFV fully homomorphic encryption scheme. Note that this can be also generalized to any RLWE-based FHE scheme. Based on https://hackmd.io/@gaussian/HJ8DYyjPp.

The repository contains a python prototype for the secret key proof of encryption and for public key proof of encryption
